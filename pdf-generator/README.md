# Coding Challenge ‚Äì ‚ÄúFrom Form to PDF‚Äù

Welcome!  
You‚Äôll build a tiny Next.js feature that takes **user-submitted data + an uploaded file** and turns it into a **single PDF**.  
Most details are intentionally vague so you can show us how you think, structure data, and make trade-offs.

---

## 1 . The (deliberately loose) user flow

1. **Entry point** ‚Äì A user visits `/apply`.
2. **Form** ‚Äì They fill out basic personal details _and_ specify their **current job description** (plain text).
3. **Upload** ‚Äì They attach **one supporting document** (pdf file type).
4. **Submit** ‚Äì After the form posts:
   - Persist everything somewhere in the repo (FS, JSON - your choice, but no need to integrate a blob storage).
   - Generate a **PDF** that contains:
     - The user‚Äôs personal details (as a nicely formatted header).
     - The job-description paragraph they typed.
     - _Any_ content you choose from the uploaded file (or a note that it‚Äôs been stored).
   - Return a link or modal so the user can download that PDF.

That‚Äôs all! How you design the data model and plumbing is up to you.

## 2.a. Starter repo

We give you a minimal **Next.js 14 / TypeScript** skeleton:

Feel free to reorganize folders, add libs, or install packages.

Next.js gives us the convenience of using their serverless api package, instead of needing to spin up a separate api server. Feel free to use it.

## 2.b. üíæ Database Instructions

To keep this project self-contained, we‚Äôll use **SQLite** with Prisma.

No hosted database is needed. Just follow these steps:

### Set up

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npx prisma db push
```

## 3 . What we care about

| Area                   | What to demonstrate                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data modeling**      | Show your reasoning: TS interfaces, Prisma schema, SQL DDL‚Äîany clear representation of how ‚ÄúUser‚Äù, ‚ÄúSubmission‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDocument‚Äù relate. |
| **Code structure**     | Separation of concerns, clear naming, testability.                                                                                      |
| **PDF generation**     | Library choice is yours (`pdf-lib`, `@react-pdf/renderer`, LaTeX + puppeteer, etc.). The result just needs to open.                     |
| **DX & README**        | `pnpm install && pnpm dev` should run; explain any env vars or scripts.                                                                 |
| **Edge-case thinking** | Basic validation, error feedback, graceful failure on large files.                                                                      |

## 4 . Deliverables

1. **Running code** committed to your repo.
2. **`/design` folder** with a short Markdown note explaining:
   - Your data model (ER diagram, schema file, or bullet list).
   - How the request travels through your code.
3. (Optional) Unit or integration tests showing something you deem critical.

## 5 . Ground rules & hints

| Topic            | Guideline                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **File storage** | Skip S3/GCS; writing to `./uploads` (git-ignored) is fine.                     |
| **Styling**      | Keep UI minimal‚Äîfocus is backend logic.                                        |
| **Libraries**    | Use anything publicly available via npm.                                       |
| **Secrets**      | Don‚Äôt commit API keys. If you need an env var, add an entry to `.env.example`. |
| **Time box**     | It‚Äôs okay to annotate unfinished areas with TODOs.                             |
